By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply.

To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n * and the account address.\n *\n * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method.
